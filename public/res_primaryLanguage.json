      "description": "I'm Kyle, and I am a software developer currently studying at Code Fellows.  Prior to this I did my best work in healthcare tech, spending 7 years in increasingly complex analyst and IT support roles.  I chose to pursue software development because the most fun I've ever had professionally has been working with engineering to implement the product team's designs.  I am certain that having lived in the support and product worlds gives me invaluable context for software design that I could only gain by first hand experience. I would like to use my powers for good and go back into healthcare tech at a small or medium sized company.  It is very important to me that the work I do could be helping someone who is struggling.  Thanks for your time.",
